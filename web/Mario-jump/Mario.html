    <p>
        I developed a simple JavaScript game called "Mario Jump." Players control Mario by pressing any key to jump over pipes. 
        It showcases my skills in JavaScript with smooth animations and interactive gameplay.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The game structure is built with HTML for clarity, styled with CSS for a visually appealing design, 
        and powered by JavaScript for real-time interaction and game mechanics.

        If you're looking for someone to bring your ideas to life with engaging web applications, 
        I would love to collaborate with you!
